With over 1 year of experience as a QA Engineer and 5 years of experience as an Industrial Automation Engineer, I possess a wide range of skills.

As a QA Engineer, I have performed manual and automated testing of a Web-application, including creating checklists and test cases, writing automated tests using PyTest and Playwright, conducting bug reporting, and requirements testing. Additionally, I have a background in writing scripts using Python, VBA, and Bash.

As an Industrial Automation Engineer, I‚Äôm experienced in customer communication, programming, testing, and commissioning of DCS systems.

I have worked in small local teams of 2-4 individuals as well as in large international teams with over 15 members. As a team player, I value close collaboration and I am eager to bring new ideas to the table. However, I am also capable of working independently when necessary.
